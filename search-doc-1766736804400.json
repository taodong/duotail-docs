","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Alias Channel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Channel","url":"/concepts/channel#alias-channel","content":" An Alias Channel is provided to all users who wish to utilize our services without verifying their legal identity. We believe everyone deserves an email address that isn't tied to their real-world persona. Consequently, every account includes at least one default alias channel, following the format: a_&lt;your_username&gt;@duotail.com.  All our alias channel starts with a prefix &quot;a_&quot;. So, via the email address itself, the recipients of these emails should be able to tell if they from an anonymous sender. For example, a person received an email from a_harry.potter@duotail.com, he can tell the sender is A Harry Potter not The Harry Potter.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Identity Channel​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Channel","url":"/concepts/channel#identity-channel","content":" An Identity Channel is assigned to users whose real-world identities have been successfully verified. Unlike alias channels, an Identity Channel email address has no prefix (e.g., isaac.swordblessing@duotail.com). This serves as a &quot;verified badge,&quot; signaling to recipients that the sender's identity is authentic and confirmed.

We're convinced that every person deserves a curated inbox. To make that a reality, we provide our full suite of incoming email controls to all customers, free of charge.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Key Concepts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Welcome to our Duotail Documentation","url":"/welcome#key-concepts","content":" To get the most out of our services, it is important to understand these three core concepts:  Channel: A channel acts as an &quot;umbrella&quot; for all email addresses starting with its name. For example, owning the channel a_happy.rhino gives you control over a_happy.rhino@duotail.com, a_happy.rhino_sports@duotail.com, and a_happy.rhino_food@duotail.com. More details can be found in the channel guide. Route: A Route defines the rules for incoming emails. The text following the last underscore in an address is the Route ID. For example, in a_happy.rhino_food@duotail.com, &quot;food&quot; is the route. If a route rule allows deliciousgrass.com, any emails from that domain will be delivered to your inbox. Contact: A Contact is a trusted sender assigned to a channel. Emails originating from a Contact bypass Route configurations to reach any address under that channel. For example, if angry.gazelle@example.com is a Contact for a_happy.rhino, their emails will always be delivered to a_happy.rhino@duotail.com, _sports, and _food regardless of specific route rules.
