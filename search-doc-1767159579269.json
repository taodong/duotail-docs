It allows for the creation of comprehensive rules to tailor incoming email permissions specifically for subscription scenarios. Subscription route allows only Domain Permission and Email Permission.  First Email Auto Permission​  When a new Subscription Route is created, we recommend leaving the permissions undefined initially. If no permissions are set, the first email to reach the route will be automatically permitted. Furthermore, the host domain of that email will be added to your permission list with the status set to &quot;Enabled.&quot; This feature is specifically designed to ensure that third-party confirmation emails reach your inbox without delay.  Subscription Route Incoming Email Decision Hierarchy​  When multiple permissions are set within a subscription route for emails from the same domain, the final decision is determined by a hierarchical &quot;top-down&quot; logic. The system searches for the most specific match first, moving to more general rules only if a match isn't found.  The Decision Hierarchy  Exact Email Match: The system first checks if the specific email address is listed. If a match is found, the email is Allowed or Denied based on that specific setting. Full Domain Match: If there is no specific email match, the system checks for a rule matching the exact domain (e.g., example.com). If a rule exists, it is applied immediately. Ancestor Domain Match: If no full domain match exists, the system looks for the closest ancestor domain (e.g., if the email is from sub.example.com, it looks for a rule for example.com). Final Fallback: If no matches are found at any level, the email is Denied by default.    Disabled Subcription Route​  If a subscription route is set to Disabled, any incoming emails directed to that specific route address are automatically trashed.  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"One-Shot Route​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Route","url":"/concepts/route#one-shot-route","content":" A One-Shot Route is designed to handle &quot;serendipity&quot; style interactions, such as those originating from networking events or public inquiries. Under this route, only the first email from a new sender is delivered to your inbox.  In addition to standard domain and email permissions, the One-Shot Route utilizes a built-in Stamp List to track previous senders. Once a sender has messaged you, they are added to this list and subsequent emails from them are blocked. To allow a follow-up email from a specific sender, you can simply remove their address from the Stamp List.  Example: Suppose hug is a One-Shot Route under the channel a_happy.rhino.  If a new sender, angry.gazelle@example.com, sends an email to this route, the message will be delivered. However, any subsequent emails from angry.gazelle@example.com will be automatically discarded.  One-Shot Route Incoming Email Decision Hierarchy​  A One-Shot Route determines whether an email is delivered using the following hierarchy:  Permission Check: The system first follows the same decision hierarchy as a Subscription Route, checking all domain and email-level permissions. If an explicit &quot;Enabled&quot; permission is found, the email is delivered immediately. Stamp List Check: If no explicit permission is found in Step 1, the system checks the Stamp List. The email will be delivered only if the sender’s address is not already present on the list.  Disabled One-Shot Route​  If a One-Shot route is set to Disabled, any incoming emails directed to that specific route address are automatically trashed.  Locked One-Shot Route​  To protect against the risk of a One-Shot email address being leaked or falling into the wrong hands, these routes can be Locked.  When a route is locked, the system skips the Stamp List check and performs a Permission Check only. In this state, only emails from senders with explicit Enabled permissions will be delivered; all other incoming emails will be blocked.
