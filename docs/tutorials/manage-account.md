# Manage Account

## Summary
The **Manage Account** page is your central hub for updating your personal profile, managing your subscription, and verifying the email addresses associated with your account.

## Account Profile
In the top section, you can manage your basic identity and security settings:
- **Account Name:** Displays the name currently associated with your account.

### Change Name
Click `Change Name` button to update your display name. Since the sender name configured at the `Channel` or `Route` level takes precedence over your `Account Display Name`, updating your name here will not change the sender name for your existing channels or routes.

### Change Password
Use `Change Password` button to update your account login password. You must provide both your current and new passwords to complete this change. Please note that submitting a password update will automatically log you out of your account on all devices.

## Subscription Management
![Subscription Section](/img/tutorials/manage-account/subscription-section.png)
This section provides details regarding your current service tier:

- **Plan:** Displays your current plan level (e.g., FREE BASIC).
- **Renewal Date:** Displays the date your subscription is scheduled to renew. Please note that a renewal date is not applicable to the FREE plan.

### Unsubcribe
We are currently refining our automated unsubscription process. In the meantime, please send your unsubscription request directly to our support team at `support@duotail.com`. We will manually downgrade your plan or delete your records as requested.

Clicking the `Unsubscribe` button will display a similar notification. **We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this manual process may cause and appreciate your patience.**

## Manage Emails
![Emails Section](/img/tutorials/manage-account/email-list.png)
You can link multiple email addresses to your Duotail account to use with various channels. All your emails will be listed under the **Emails** section. 

- **Primary Email:** Labeled with a green `primary` tag. This is your main contact address for account notifications.
- **Unverified Email:** Labled with a yellow `unverified` tag. This is an email address that has not yet been confirmed. Clicking the 'Verify Email' button will trigger a new confirmation email to be sent to that address.

### Add Email
Use the `Add Email` button to link a new email address to your account. Upon submission, the new email will appear in the Emails list with a yellow `unverified` tag.

### Verify Email
For any unverified address, click `Verify Email` button to trigger a confirmation email. You must verify an email before it can be used for channel routing.

### Change Primary Email
You can update your primary email address by clicking the `Make Primary` button located next to any non-primary email address.
