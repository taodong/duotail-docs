# How to Ensure Duotail Emails Reach Your Inbox

This guide explains how to whitelist our domain by creating filters in major email service providers.

## Why is this necessary?
Our service is in its early stages, and major providers are still learning to recognize our domain. Without whitelist our domain, your emails through our service will be sent to junk/spam folder. By setting this filter, you are telling your provider that you trust `duotail.com`, which helps us improve our reputation and ensures your emails reach your inbox as intended.
