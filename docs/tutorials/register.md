# Register An Account

## Register Process

To start using our service, begin by registering for a free account. The username you choose will serve as your [alias channel](/concepts/channel#alias-channel) with the structure `a_<your_username>`. Upon successful registration, all duotail.com emails starting with this alias belong to you.
