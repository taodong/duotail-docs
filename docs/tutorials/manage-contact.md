# Manage Contacts

:::info 
We approach the concept of a **Contact** differently than traditional email systems. If you are new to our platform, we highly recommend reading our [Contact Guide](/concepts/contact) to understand how these unique relationships work and how to manage them effectively.
:::

## Summary
**Contact Management** is located within the **Contacts** section of each individual channel page. To access it, simply click **CONTACTS** on the top menu bar.

## Contacts Table
The **Contacts Table** is the central component of the **Contacts** section, displaying all existing contacts configured under the current channel.
Each row in the table provides a summary of a specific contact's details:
- **Contact Email:** The external, real-world email address of your contact.
- **Name:** A display name used to identify the contact (independent of their email address).
- **Email to Send:** The specific `duotail.com` address you should use in the `To` (Recipient) field when composing an email to this contact. Every address used as an `Email to Send` follows this specific structure: `2_<your_input>@duotail.com`.
- **Route (Optional):** A specific route you wish to designate as the `Sender` address for this contact. The channel email will be used when it's empty.
- **Notes (Optional):** A field for any personal reminders or extra information regarding the contact.
- **Actions:** Management tools available for the contact, such as `Edit` or `Delete`.

## Add a Contact
To add a new contact, click the `Add Contact` button located directly below the `Contacts Table`. This will open the `Add Contact` configuration window.
