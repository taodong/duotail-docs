# Welcome to our Duotail Documentation 

Let's discover our **Email Proxy Service in less than 5 minutes**.

## Purpose

The sole purpose of our service is to grant every person full control over tailoring their incoming emails. 

We're convinced that every user deserves a curated inbox. To make that a reality, we provide our full suite of incoming email controls to all customers, free of charge.

## Key Concepts

There are three key concepts (terminologies) which are crucial to use our services:
- Channel: a channel holds configurations for any email addresses starting with its name. For example, a channel "a_happy.rhino" is the umbrella of emails "a_happy.rhino@duotail.com", "a_happy.rhino_pounce@duotail.com", "a_happy.rhino_nap@duotail.com" etc.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/welcome.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
